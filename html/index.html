          <h1>VPN</h1>
          <strong>What Is a VPN and What Can (and Can’t) It Do?</strong>
          <p>
VPN (or virtual private network) services create a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and a VPN server at another location. That type of secure connection is a worthwhile investment for anyone who wants to wrap their data in an extra layer of privacy and security, especially when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. But a VPN is not a magic bullet for Internet security and won’t make you anonymous online.
<br>
<br>
<strong>How a VPN works</strong> 
<br>
Normally your connection—and the data carried over it—goes from your computer to your local Wi-Fi or network router, then bounces on through your ISP’s network and off to the destination server (like wirecutter.com), eventually returning with the requested data (like this webpage). At any stop along the way, someone could theoretically see the data and where it’s coming from and going to.
<br>
Connecting through a VPN, though, encrypts all of the Internet traffic between your computer and the VPN server, preventing anyone on your local network, or at connection points along the way, from monitoring or modifying your traffic. Beyond the VPN server (in other words, the rest of the way to whatever Internet server you’re connecting to), your traffic mixes with traffic from other people on the same VPN—someone monitoring the connection to the destination server could see that your traffic came from the VPN server, but wouldn’t be able to know it was destined for your computer or device. Though these extra steps and encryption layers slow down any Internet connection, the best VPN providers have connections that are speedy enough to keep browsing and online services snappy.
<br>
You don’t need to understand exactly how a VPN works to use one, but you do need to know what a VPN is good for—and what it’s not—before choosing whether or not to pay for one. We run through the most common uses, and how well a VPN works for each, below.

                Technology has evolved remarkably over the past few decades. The beginning of modern technology could be seen in early 1800s – the start of industrial revolution and since then there has been no looking back.<br>
                Gone are the days of waiting for months to receive a letter from your friend or relative residing in a distant place. At the click of some buttons you can talk to anyone sitting in a remote part of the world. Earlier people used to flock to library for research work or pleasure reading which has now been replaced with e books and search engines. Some 100 years back, people could not predict the incoming hurricane, its position and time of attack but now anyone with a mobile phone can find these details and interpret it accurately. The outdoor activities have now been replaced with computers and Play Station. Now a days, kids prefer spending time on what their virtual friends are up to rather than spending quality time with their family or friends.<br>
                Technology is advancing with a speed of light making it difficult to cope up with. It has transformed our lives and has turned the world into a global village. Its potential is limitless and awaits great discoveries in the near future.
